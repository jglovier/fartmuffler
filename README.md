# Fart Muffler ðŸ’¨:dash:

This repo was born as a silly test repo for designing and developing features while I worked at GitHub. But why not bring it to life?

## What I'd like to build

A silly little website that makes fart noises, and an optional fart filter that is the "fart muffler".

## But why?

Wrong question. The real question is, why not?!

JK. Of course there's lots of reasons not to waste time, effort, energy (both my own and the energy that will be consumed and fueled by fossile fuels while I build this on my machine and when I host it on some server somewhere), and brainpower to build something silly.

So the real justification for me is levity and learning.

I'd like to build something with code that can make people laugh, and I'd like to use the opportunity to learn a new technology (perhaps React? perhaps a cool node library for working with audio in a UI?).

## Next steps

IDK yet! This is very much a backburner/low priority project. Just an idea right now.

Probably the best next step for me is to:
1. visualize what the initial user experience would be like
2. sketch out the tech solution
3. fill in the details
